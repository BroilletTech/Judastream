WEBVTT

00:20.562 --> 00:21.688
Hurry up!

00:28.778 --> 00:29.904
Stay sharp!

00:35.910 --> 00:37.078
A woman?!

00:37.078 --> 00:38.580
Not a dragon?

00:39.247 --> 00:40.957
Tio!

00:40.957 --> 00:42.250
Are you all right?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.919
Tio!

00:47.005 --> 00:49.257
Kaori...

00:49.257 --> 00:54.095
Yes, I'm actually quite fine.
Just a bit tired.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.934
Tio... What about
Hajime-<i>kun </i>and the others?

00:59.934 --> 01:02.729
Why are you alone?

01:02.729 --> 01:04.856
Calm down, Kaori.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.816
What about that volcano eruption?!

02:44.122 --> 02:46.666
So Hajime-<i>kun </i>is...

02:46.666 --> 02:50.754
Yes, they should be
catching up with us soon.

02:50.754 --> 02:54.591
Master was not pessimistic
in the slightest.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.761
I'm sure he had some plan to get out.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.766
Kaori, I have a message from Master.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.517
From Hajime-<i>kun</i>?

03:04.517 --> 03:09.064
Yes. Well, to Kaori and Myu both,
to be exact, but...

03:09.064 --> 03:11.941
"See you later," he said.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.361
Kaori?

03:14.361 --> 03:18.740
Right, yes. Good...
He should be all right then.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.993
Even if the situation
seems hopeless to others,

03:21.993 --> 03:26.331
Master will survive and
act like nothing happened.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.958
That we can believe, without a doubt.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.794
Yes.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.713
Aren't we going to go pick up Papa?

03:33.713 --> 03:38.843
We need to believe in Papa Hajime
and do what we need to do on our side.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.471
Only then can we go pick him up.

03:41.471 --> 03:47.227
Oh, but we can't take Myu-<i>chan</i>
to the Grand Gruen Volcano.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.896
In that case, why don't
we head over to Erisen first

03:49.896 --> 03:52.315
and reunite Myu with her mother?

03:52.315 --> 03:55.276
Right! That's what we'll do.

04:16.464 --> 04:20.135
How many days has it been...?

04:20.135 --> 04:23.096
Hajime, how are you feeling?

04:23.096 --> 04:27.976
I'm fine. It'll just take me
a while longer to fully recover.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.978
How about you, Yue?

04:29.978 --> 04:34.482
I'm fine. Shea shared
some of her blood with me.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.610
Oh, Yue-<i>san</i>, why are you sitting on me?

04:37.610 --> 04:40.113
Because there's a Hajime there.

04:42.824 --> 04:46.619
The poison from the Burning Light
is almost gone. That's good.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.747
I told you, I'm fine.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.708
But I'm still worried.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.670
I'm glad we have a chance to rest up,
though the location isn't ideal.

04:55.670 --> 04:59.924
Yeah, that was a crazy chain of events.

04:59.924 --> 05:02.927
I don't know if we're
really lucky or really unlucky.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.778
Hajime-<i>san</i>! It's close!

05:44.928 --> 05:47.514
Good, we're safe for now.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.599
Hajime, look.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.687
A magic circle.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.782
This is... a magic that controls space?

06:05.782 --> 06:07.909
The secret to that instant movement trick.

06:07.909 --> 06:11.663
Oh, you mean how
he suddenly appeared behind us.

06:18.712 --> 06:24.634
I sincerely hope that the future of
humankind will be based on free will...

06:24.634 --> 06:26.678
Naiz Gruen.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.723
Simple.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.267
It's like he tidied up his life.

06:32.267 --> 06:36.938
It doesn't seem like Naiz-<i>san </i>left
anything behind other than the magic.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.829
So, we got the proof
of conquest and the magic.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.914
Now to get out of here...

06:54.914 --> 07:00.795
Right, but Spatial Magic is hard
to use, we can't use it just yet.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.173
You do have a plan, right?

07:03.173 --> 07:07.677
The outside is probably
completely full of lava by now.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.221
We'll swim through the lava.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.806
Hmm?

07:11.806 --> 07:13.600
Huh?

07:15.268 --> 07:19.147
Please don't look at me like that...

07:25.945 --> 07:29.824
I actually made a ship
that can travel underwater.

07:29.824 --> 07:35.914
The Sunken Ruins of Melusine is next,
and I was sure we'd need one for that.

07:35.914 --> 07:41.086
I was a bit worried about whether
or not it could withstand the lava, but...

08:00.313 --> 08:02.899
Looks like it'll do fine.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.366
Huh?! What's going on?!

08:11.366 --> 08:13.868
Dammit, I lost control.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.036
If this were an eruption,

08:15.036 --> 08:17.580
we'd just get tossed outside
and all would be good, but...

08:21.209 --> 08:25.505
Seems like we're getting pushed
straight down... Or no, diagonally down.

08:25.505 --> 08:30.969
You mean we're going deeper underground?!

08:30.969 --> 08:34.180
Yue, Shea, I don't think we're
getting out of here very soon.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.725
Seems like we have to take
this trip to wherever we end up.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.270
I'll be by your side until the end.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.605
As long as I can do that,
I'll have no regrets.

08:42.605 --> 08:46.276
Literally come hell or high water, huh?

08:46.276 --> 08:51.031
I'll also follow you two
to wherever you might go!

09:22.228 --> 09:24.606
Dammit, it's out of ammo!

09:24.606 --> 09:26.024
I got this.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.746
Yue! Take my blood.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.790
No, I can still...

09:41.790 --> 09:42.624
Yue...

09:42.624 --> 09:46.378
Have you two forgotten about someone?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.923
Use my blood, please!

10:09.275 --> 10:10.443
What about Shea?

10:10.443 --> 10:15.323
She gave me a lot of blood, so I don't
think she'll be getting up anytime soon.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.574
I see...

10:18.451 --> 10:24.416
Hmm? Are you awake? How are you?

10:24.416 --> 10:29.170
Thank you for your totally natural
reaction as if nothing happened.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.924
I am absolutely fine. Oh, indeed I am!

10:32.924 --> 10:35.802
That's good to hear.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.930
I wonder where we are?

10:38.930 --> 10:40.557
Who knows?

10:40.557 --> 10:47.063
I'd like to run some tests,
but the Treasure Trove is with Tio.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.940
We travel wherever the wind takes us.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.568
Doesn't that mean we're lost?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.195
Hmm?

10:58.616 --> 11:01.202
Who are you?! Why are you here?!

11:01.202 --> 11:02.912
What is this thing you're riding?

11:05.832 --> 11:08.460
You won't get us to lower our guards!

11:08.460 --> 11:10.920
Is that the trick you
used to kidnap the girl?!

11:10.920 --> 11:13.798
Are you here to
steal more of our children?!

11:15.050 --> 11:16.926
Are you talking about Myu?

11:16.926 --> 11:19.346
Oh, in that case, we--

11:19.346 --> 11:23.391
Silence! Who allowed
you to speak, rabbitman?!

11:29.314 --> 11:30.398
Nice shot.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.568
Wait, something just...

11:33.568 --> 11:34.402
What is it?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.445
--Papa!

11:35.445 --> 11:37.030
--What is this?
--Papa!

11:38.406 --> 11:39.282
No way.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.326
Papa!

11:43.495 --> 11:44.996
Myu?!

12:00.887 --> 12:03.390
Papa!

12:04.391 --> 12:06.059
Myu...

12:16.069 --> 12:19.114
Sorry, Papa...

12:19.114 --> 12:22.784
Can you promise that you won't do
something dangerous like that again?

12:22.784 --> 12:24.411
Yes, I can.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.454
All right, then I forgive you.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.956
Papa!

12:29.874 --> 12:34.087
I'm so glad... I'm so glad!

12:34.087 --> 12:39.759
Sorry to worry you. But as
you can see, I'm totally fine. So...

12:39.759 --> 12:45.140
So stop crying. Seeing you cry is...
bad, in lots of ways.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.144
Well, then...

12:50.895 --> 12:53.565
Just a little while longer...

12:56.317 --> 12:57.444
What?!

12:57.444 --> 12:59.654
H-Hey! Tio!

12:59.654 --> 13:03.783
I believed in you!
I totally believed in you, but...

13:03.783 --> 13:07.203
But being together with you, it's...

13:07.203 --> 13:11.291
Please give me some
of your time, my master!

13:11.291 --> 13:15.420
Please, master! Give me a reward!

13:29.351 --> 13:33.813
"Erisen, City on the Sea"

13:39.861 --> 13:41.946
Hey, that girl, is that...?

13:41.946 --> 13:46.284
Yeah, it is. She's Remia's daughter,
the one who got kidnapped.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.917
I authorize the completion of the mission
given from the guild branch master.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.087
Thank you, gold-rank adventurer,
Mr. Nagumo.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.506
I'm sure you have tons
of questions, but for now,

13:59.506 --> 14:04.386
can we take her to her mother?

14:04.386 --> 14:06.137
I guess I have no choice.

14:06.137 --> 14:10.517
The sighting of the dragon out at sea,
and that ship-like vehicle...

14:10.517 --> 14:13.728
As a soldier of the kingdom,
I cannot ignore those things.

14:13.728 --> 14:19.734
I'll be staying in Erisen for a while.
How about we chat about it next time?

14:19.734 --> 14:22.320
If there is an opportunity to talk,
then that's fine.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.031
I'll ask again after you've settled down.

14:25.031 --> 14:28.410
The talk is over!
If you're going to continue to loiter,

14:28.410 --> 14:32.622
I'll arrest you all for interfering
with a soldier's duties!

14:33.456 --> 14:37.419
Papa, I'm going home! Mama's waiting!

14:37.419 --> 14:39.004
I wanna see Mama!

14:39.004 --> 14:41.965
Yeah, let's hurry and go see her.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.805
Papa! This way!

14:48.805 --> 14:50.348
Yeah, yeah.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.850
Hurry!

14:55.061 --> 14:57.689
Remia, calm down!
You can't go with that leg!

14:57.689 --> 15:01.526
Come on, Remia!
We'll bring Myu back, we promise!

15:01.526 --> 15:06.322
No! If Myu is back, I have to go get her!

15:06.322 --> 15:08.324
Mama!

15:08.324 --> 15:09.868
Myu?! Myu!

15:09.868 --> 15:11.911
Mama!

15:13.788 --> 15:18.585
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry
I couldn't protect you, Myu...

15:18.585 --> 15:24.466
It's fine, Mama.
Myu is right here. So, it's fine.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.178
Myu...

15:29.554 --> 15:31.556
I'm so glad!

15:31.556 --> 15:32.557
Mama!

15:32.557 --> 15:36.936
Your leg! What happened?
Are you hurt? Does it hurt?!

15:36.936 --> 15:41.232
Papa! Help Mama! Mama's leg hurts!

15:41.232 --> 15:43.860
--What?! Myu, what did you just say?

15:43.860 --> 15:45.570
--Papa! Hurry!
--What?! Myu, what did you just say?

15:45.570 --> 15:49.866
Oh? Oh? Did you really say Papa?

15:49.866 --> 15:52.369
P-Papa?! Does she mean me?!

15:52.369 --> 15:55.121
No way! It has to be me!

15:55.121 --> 15:56.748
No, she's talking about me!

15:56.748 --> 15:59.000
Papa, Mama is...

15:59.000 --> 16:03.046
Don't worry, Myu. She'll be fine.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.091
So don't be worried.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.926
Yes...

16:09.803 --> 16:12.764
Sorry about this, excuse me.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.307
Huh?

16:15.767 --> 16:16.976
Oh?

16:21.856 --> 16:25.318
Remia is getting re-married?
It can't be...

16:25.318 --> 16:29.531
Remia is finally seeing
someone again? That's great!

16:29.531 --> 16:34.994
I see. So, you got hurt by
the guys who kidnapped Myu...

16:34.994 --> 16:37.038
How is she, Kaori?

16:37.038 --> 16:41.543
Good, she'll be fine.
I can heal this properly.

16:41.543 --> 16:48.049
I'd like to spend a few days and take some
time with her to avoid any side effects.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.510
It might be a bit
uncomfortable until then,

16:50.510 --> 16:54.055
but I will heal this, please rest assured.

16:54.055 --> 16:59.644
Oh my, oh my. I was told
nobody could fix this wound.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.813
I don't know how to thank you...

17:02.939 --> 17:08.486
So, um, how did you meet Myu?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.780
And also...

17:10.780 --> 17:14.659
...why does Myu call you Papa?

17:16.286 --> 17:18.872
It's a long story but...

17:21.166 --> 17:25.837
It's thanks to you that I was
able to reunite with my daughter.

17:25.837 --> 17:29.007
I will repay this debt,
even it takes the rest of my life.

17:29.007 --> 17:33.178
Don't worry about it.
You're Myu-<i>chan</i>'s mother, after all.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.055
Right.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.265
Don't worry about it.

17:39.059 --> 17:42.604
I heard you're planning on
staying in town for a while.

17:42.604 --> 17:47.233
In that case, please stay in this house.
Myu would like that, too.

17:47.233 --> 17:53.656
No, we're fine.
There was a good inn near the pier.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.992
I want to run maintenance
on the ship, too.

17:55.992 --> 18:00.830
Oh my, is Papa distancing himself
from his daughter? That's not right.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.460
Papa... are you going away?

18:05.460 --> 18:06.628
Huh?

18:06.628 --> 18:09.506
I understand that you'll
have to leave at some point.

18:09.506 --> 18:15.679
That's why, while you're here,
I want you to be her Papa.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.100
That said, we don't have
to limit it to the day you leave.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.686
You can be her Papa forever,

18:22.686 --> 18:25.939
since after all, I do intend
to repay you with my life...

18:25.939 --> 18:29.067
Please don't make jokes like that...

18:29.067 --> 18:32.153
I can feel the temperature drop
from all the cold stares.

18:32.153 --> 18:35.740
Oh my, you sure are
popular with the ladies.

18:35.740 --> 18:40.161
But it's been five years
since I lost my husband...

18:40.161 --> 18:41.955
Myu, you want a Papa, too, don't you?

18:41.955 --> 18:44.916
Huh? Papa is Papa.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.586
Did you hear that? Papa.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.965
Hey, emergency meeting!

18:51.965 --> 18:53.675
This one's going to be rough!

19:02.809 --> 19:08.106
She did say she was going to
report to the king first...

19:15.613 --> 19:18.658
Sensei! Long time no see!

19:18.658 --> 19:21.953
What?! Yaegashi-<i>san</i>?!

19:23.455 --> 19:26.041
I'm sorry about Shimizu-<i>kun</i>.

19:26.041 --> 19:31.046
But still, I'm glad you survived, Sensei.

19:31.046 --> 19:33.840
We really have to thank Nagumo-<i>kun</i>.

19:35.425 --> 19:41.097
He went to save you and the others.
And he saved a little girl, too...

19:41.097 --> 19:42.223
Yes.

19:42.223 --> 19:46.853
Perhaps he's remembering
his previous self.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.690
Either that, or he's still changed,
but ever-growing.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.068
What a reliable person.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.407
Ahem!

19:59.407 --> 20:04.537
Sensei? You told me earlier that you
were saved from a dangerous situation,

20:04.537 --> 20:06.122
but how exactly?

20:06.122 --> 20:07.207
Huh?!

20:07.207 --> 20:10.251
I mean, since you said you almost died,

20:10.251 --> 20:13.672
it makes me curious
about how you recovered...

20:13.672 --> 20:17.759
W-W-W-Well, about that...

20:18.885 --> 20:22.389
Sensei, did something happen
between you and Nagumo-<i>kun</i>?

20:22.389 --> 20:25.558
No! I mean, what do
you mean by "something"?

20:25.558 --> 20:28.728
He and I are a typical student
and teacher! Ain't no doubt!

20:28.728 --> 20:32.774
Sensei, please calm down.
You're speaking nonsense.

20:34.609 --> 20:38.363
Nagumo-<i>kun</i>, what did you do to Ai-<i>chan</i>...?

20:39.364 --> 20:45.078
Sensei, what happened when
you made the report to the king?

20:45.078 --> 20:49.874
Nagumo-<i>kun </i>has officially
been branded a heretic.

20:49.874 --> 20:54.004
Why?! That's far too thoughtless!

20:54.004 --> 20:59.384
I agree completely. Even though he's a
strong force that won't obey the church,

20:59.384 --> 21:03.930
he did save the town of Ur after all.

21:03.930 --> 21:09.144
But still, no matter how much
I objected, they didn't listen.

21:09.144 --> 21:13.356
They're not supposed to be
able to ignore my objections...

21:13.356 --> 21:16.151
If they're branding Nagumo-<i>kun </i>a heretic,

21:16.151 --> 21:20.196
doesn't that mean they're denying
the Goddess of Fertility, too?

21:21.114 --> 21:23.575
Clearly, there's something wrong.

21:23.575 --> 21:30.540
Come to think of it, the king and other
officials seemed... somewhat odd.

21:30.540 --> 21:35.503
That's concerning. What are they thinking?

21:35.503 --> 21:40.717
Nagumo-<i>kun </i>is so strong.
Who will they send after him?

21:40.717 --> 21:47.724
Yaegashi-<i>san</i>. There's something
that Nagumo-<i>kun </i>revealed to me.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.059
Revealed?

21:49.059 --> 21:52.687
Yes. About the god that
the church is worshipping

21:52.687 --> 21:55.065
and what Nagumo-<i>kun</i>'s goal is.

21:55.065 --> 22:00.653
I don't have any proof,
but it's important...

22:03.615 --> 22:08.370
I'd like to talk to you all
about this as soon as possible.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.008
Next episode,
"Memories from the Bottom of the Sea."
