WEBVTT

00:10.135 --> 00:13.471
Grand Gruen Volcano, conquest complete!

00:16.558 --> 00:18.268
The end!

00:30.488 --> 00:32.991
Hajime!

02:22.559 --> 02:23.852
Updraft!

02:32.402 --> 02:35.030
Hajime! Hajime!

02:48.960 --> 02:50.170
Hajime...

02:59.220 --> 03:00.055
Hajime?!

03:00.055 --> 03:01.806
Fool! Above you!

03:04.768 --> 03:06.728
Not on my watch. Tempest Void!

03:08.229 --> 03:09.606
Herem!

03:25.413 --> 03:26.331
Hajime-<i>san</i>!

03:26.331 --> 03:28.083
Shea!

03:28.083 --> 03:33.630
Calm down! If you leave my defenses now,
not even you would survive!

03:59.489 --> 04:03.785
Setting the ambush here was a good idea.

04:14.754 --> 04:20.927
You pose too great a risk to ignore.
Especially that man...

04:24.264 --> 04:28.852
How did he survive a direct hit
from Uranus's breath?

04:28.852 --> 04:34.065
Who are you? How many Age of Gods
magics have you learned?

04:34.065 --> 04:38.862
Why don't you introduce yourself properly
before you start asking questions?

04:39.612 --> 04:44.617
Don't you demons have any manners?

04:44.617 --> 04:45.827
Hajime!

04:54.794 --> 04:55.670
Hajime-<i>san</i>!

04:55.670 --> 04:58.381
Are you all right, master?!

04:58.381 --> 05:03.136
I don't see any value in introducing
myself to someone who's about to die.

05:03.136 --> 05:09.059
Don't worry, I'm just playing with tropes.
I actually don't care.

05:09.059 --> 05:13.146
By the way, how's your friend's arm?

05:15.357 --> 05:18.401
I hope he likes his new style.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.657
My name is Freid Bagwa.

05:24.657 --> 05:30.538
I am God's obedient Apostle,
who brings divine punishment to heathens.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.124
God's Apostle, right...

05:33.124 --> 05:39.089
I guess learning an Age of Gods magic
gave you the right to call yourself that?

05:39.089 --> 05:44.552
You're sharp. When I gained
the powers of the Age of Gods,

05:44.552 --> 05:49.974
my God spoke to me directly,
addressing me as his Apostle.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.434
Huh.

05:51.434 --> 05:56.940
That's why I will sacrifice anything
to make my God's wish come true.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.610
Your existence is an obstacle to that.

06:00.610 --> 06:04.114
So, I will remove you with all my might.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.244
Those are my lines.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.704
What?

06:10.704 --> 06:14.582
You stand in my way,
that makes you my enemy.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.294
I kill all of my enemies!

06:27.012 --> 06:31.182
You thought I only
brought dragons with me?

06:36.396 --> 06:40.400
This defense can't be penetrated easily.

06:40.400 --> 06:46.197
Now, I'll show you the Age of Gods
power I have earned!

06:47.490 --> 06:49.784
I desire the end and
walk heaven and earth.

06:49.784 --> 06:53.997
My hands reach nothing
and drift beyond dreams.

06:53.997 --> 06:57.292
--Then I shall seek a fissure,
a break in the seamless world.
--I won't let you!

06:57.292 --> 07:02.339
I break a hole in the boundaries and
create a corridor into the divine realm!

07:02.339 --> 07:03.882
Cosmic Rift!

07:08.553 --> 07:10.388
Behind you, Hajime-<i>san</i>!

07:22.984 --> 07:24.069
Hajime!

07:24.069 --> 07:25.028
Hajime-<i>san</i>!

07:25.028 --> 07:26.446
Master?!

07:31.868 --> 07:35.246
How did I let myself get so complacent?

07:38.833 --> 07:41.211
Master is still human.

07:41.211 --> 07:46.049
He could get hurt, and one mistake
could result in instant death.

07:47.676 --> 07:52.055
Then what can I do?

07:56.518 --> 07:58.186
Survive.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.189
Father, but, we're...

08:01.189 --> 08:06.611
From now on, the dragonborn
must hide from the outside world.

08:06.611 --> 08:11.991
The dragonborn are now enemies of God.

08:11.991 --> 08:16.413
If it becomes known
that any of us survived,

08:16.413 --> 08:19.916
they will surely start
a massive hunt to kill us off.

08:19.916 --> 08:24.254
So I must stay in hiding forever?

08:24.254 --> 08:27.799
No. Only until the right time comes.

08:28.883 --> 08:34.347
Without virtue, we are mere beasts.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.560
But as long as we
wield the sword of reason...

08:39.853 --> 08:42.605
We are dragonborn!

08:42.605 --> 08:46.401
What is this power?
I can't hold my ground.

08:46.401 --> 08:50.697
Dammit! Limit Break!

09:00.373 --> 09:01.791
Cross Bit!

09:21.186 --> 09:26.024
How tenacious is he? I'm so close,
yet I can't land the finishing blow.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.110
--I desire...
--Not on my watch!

09:38.912 --> 09:40.580
I-Impossible!

09:43.625 --> 09:45.377
A Black Dragon?!

10:02.310 --> 10:06.064
Th-The dragonborn were wiped out!

10:06.064 --> 10:09.317
I won't let you hurt my master anymore!

10:09.317 --> 10:12.445
Remember this, young lad!

10:12.445 --> 10:15.365
This is what a real dragon's
breath feels like!

10:27.085 --> 10:32.173
I never thought I would see a
dragonborn survivor in such a place...

10:33.508 --> 10:35.760
I have no choice.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.056
This is still risky, but I will use
magic on this entire area to...

10:40.056 --> 10:41.474
No way.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.685
Dammit, time's up.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.237
Master! Hold on!

11:37.989 --> 11:39.449
Tio...

11:50.418 --> 11:56.633
Terrifying combat powers. Those women
serving him are extraordinary as well.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.470
A dragonborn, thought to be extinct.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.515
A magic user who can cast
without chants or magic circles.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.933
A rabbitman with inhuman strength

12:04.933 --> 12:08.144
and what seems like
an ability to see the future...

12:08.687 --> 12:11.690
I never thought
I would be this threatened

12:11.690 --> 12:13.983
even with my Age of Gods powers.

12:15.068 --> 12:21.574
If I didn't land that first blow, I might
have been the one who was defeated.

12:21.574 --> 12:26.204
Why are you acting
like you've already won?

12:26.204 --> 12:29.165
I'm still in this fight.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.626
I'm sure you are.

12:31.626 --> 12:34.587
The torrent of murderous intent
coming out of you is still strong.

12:34.587 --> 12:38.091
Perhaps your most terrifying
aspect is not your combat abilities...

12:40.093 --> 12:46.016
...but rather,
your unstoppable intent to kill...

12:46.016 --> 12:49.769
No, your insistence on survival.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.733
I didn't want to use this tactic.

12:54.733 --> 13:00.488
I'll have to say it's a worthy sacrifice,
to kill a powerful foe like you.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.532
What are you talking about?

13:09.789 --> 13:12.417
Hajime-<i>san</i>! The lava is rising!

13:19.007 --> 13:21.301
What did you do?

13:22.052 --> 13:24.721
I just destroyed the cornerstone.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.806
The cornerstone?

13:26.806 --> 13:30.852
Didn't you notice
something odd about this lava?

13:30.852 --> 13:34.773
The Grand Gruen Volcano
is clearly an active volcano.

13:34.773 --> 13:40.403
Yet there are no
records of it ever erupting.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.405
That must mean...

13:45.909 --> 13:52.749
There is something controlling
the magma chamber underneath.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.417
You?!

14:08.348 --> 14:11.518
Just like you imagined.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.979
You will perish here,
along with the Great Labyrinth.

14:21.069 --> 14:21.945
Hajime?

14:21.945 --> 14:22.821
Hajime-<i>san</i>?

14:22.821 --> 14:24.406
Master?

14:29.160 --> 14:32.831
Tio, listen.

14:32.831 --> 14:36.501
Take this, and escape via the roof.

14:38.294 --> 14:42.090
Master, are you singling me out

14:42.090 --> 14:45.301
as unworthy of spending
your last moments together?

14:45.301 --> 14:47.470
That's not it.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.932
There's no time,
so I'll just say this once.

14:50.932 --> 14:54.644
I haven't given up on anything.

14:54.644 --> 14:59.774
I will get the Age of Gods magic,
I will beat that guy up one day.

14:59.774 --> 15:04.612
I will deliver the Stillstone
to Ankaji, as I promised.

15:04.612 --> 15:11.244
But I can't do it all alone.
That's why I need your help.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.916
You're the only one who
can punch through the obstacles

15:16.916 --> 15:20.754
and return to Ankaji quickly.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.839
I need your help, Tio!

15:24.674 --> 15:26.092
Understood!

15:31.431 --> 15:36.519
Tio, a message to Kaori and Myu.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.064
"See you later."

15:41.024 --> 15:43.068
Fully understood.

16:14.224 --> 16:18.645
This pain is nothing,
or rather, it feels good!

16:18.645 --> 16:21.064
Bring it on!

16:21.064 --> 16:22.649
I'm counting on you.

16:36.955 --> 16:43.628
Pain Conversion.
Receiving pain boosts all of my stats.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.297
It's all Hajime's fault.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.341
What?!

16:49.634 --> 16:51.803
Fine, do your worst!

16:59.310 --> 17:01.646
Oh, how wonderful!

17:01.646 --> 17:08.069
I love you, my master!

17:10.280 --> 17:14.659
It escaped from that situation?!
What a group of monsters.

17:14.659 --> 17:18.872
But the black dragon is heavily injured.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.874
I'll finish it off, right here and--

17:39.309 --> 17:44.230
I believe in you, master, Yue, Shea...

17:53.698 --> 17:56.534
The Grand Gruen Volcano just erupted!

17:56.534 --> 17:57.994
What?!

18:04.918 --> 18:07.087
Father, please, wait!

18:07.087 --> 18:09.339
Father!

18:09.339 --> 18:11.508
Where are you going?

18:15.679 --> 18:17.514
Father?

18:35.657 --> 18:38.159
There she is.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.931
Go, Flash Claw!

18:59.931 --> 19:01.391
What?

19:11.985 --> 19:15.363
Where did you get in from?

19:15.363 --> 19:21.536
Are you a noble's pet or something?
Did you escape from your master?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.540
S-So cute...

19:27.417 --> 19:30.128
You're so cute, meow.

19:30.128 --> 19:34.382
But you're also a naughty,
naughty kitty for running away.

19:34.382 --> 19:39.637
Shizuku will punish you for being
such a naughty, naughty kitty!

19:39.637 --> 19:42.932
Hey, where are you going...

19:50.148 --> 19:53.485
I noticed you weren't with Kouki-<i>san</i>,

19:53.485 --> 19:57.739
so I came out to look for you... Meow?

20:00.992 --> 20:05.413
No! Don't look at me like this!

20:05.413 --> 20:08.583
Kill me now, meow!

20:10.335 --> 20:13.838
So what did the castle officials
and church have to say?

20:13.838 --> 20:17.092
They kept going on about how
Kouki needs to get powerful enough

20:17.092 --> 20:21.054
to fight the Demons,

20:21.054 --> 20:23.390
and quickly.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.433
What about Nagumo-<i>kun</i>?

20:25.433 --> 20:28.311
This hasn't been decided yet, but...

20:29.020 --> 20:30.647
Lily?

20:30.647 --> 20:36.069
There's been some discussion about
branding Nagumo-<i>san </i>as a heretic.

20:36.069 --> 20:39.614
You're... not kidding.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.199
Unfortunately...

20:45.578 --> 20:47.664
What is this?!

20:47.664 --> 20:49.457
You've got to be kidding me!

20:49.457 --> 20:52.335
How is he still alive, dammit!

20:52.335 --> 20:54.671
You don't seem too happy.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.175
It's only natural.

20:59.175 --> 21:04.848
Your lovely princess just got
taken away, right in front of you.

21:04.848 --> 21:10.770
Go away! He was alive!
There's no reason for me to obey you!

21:10.770 --> 21:12.063
Don't you want her?

21:12.063 --> 21:13.106
What?

21:13.106 --> 21:16.526
If she was taken from you,
just take her back.

21:16.526 --> 21:17.402
You...

21:17.402 --> 21:22.657
Just because he survived, doesn't change
the fact that you tried to kill him.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.369
Attempted murder,
that's what it's called, right?

21:26.369 --> 21:30.832
I'd rather not accuse
a classmate if I had a choice.

21:30.832 --> 21:33.001
You're still trying to blackmail me?!

21:33.001 --> 21:36.796
I'm not saying you
have to obey me blindly.

21:38.006 --> 21:40.925
Like before, it's a trade.

21:40.925 --> 21:46.598
You get what you want,
I get what I want.

21:48.641 --> 21:52.729
Let's wrap this up.

21:52.729 --> 21:57.067
After that, your wishes will come true.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.235
My...

22:03.114 --> 22:04.616
...wishes...

23:41.963 --> 23:44.758
Next episode, "Reunion."
