WEBVTT

00:13.919 --> 00:16.000
Isn't this a grand view?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.120
Yeah, it's a beautiful city.

00:23.339 --> 00:26.500
It looks kind of empty, though.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.579
I wish I could have shown you
how lively the city was before,

00:29.579 --> 00:31.010
but we have no time.

00:31.870 --> 00:33.780
Let's report to my father first.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.110
Bize, did you bring help?

02:15.539 --> 02:18.370
Wait, did you catch the fever, too?!

02:18.370 --> 02:20.610
F-Father...

02:22.349 --> 02:27.120
I hear that you're going to
save our nation and people.

02:27.599 --> 02:28.879
I guess.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.590
There are so many of them.

02:34.590 --> 02:36.759
Shea, let's begin.

02:47.150 --> 02:48.139
Asura.

02:59.669 --> 03:00.610
Tidal Wave.

03:08.110 --> 03:09.599
I can't believe it.

03:09.599 --> 03:11.539
This should last for the time being.

03:31.849 --> 03:34.819
I wish I could do that once more!

03:34.819 --> 03:36.689
Me too!

03:37.360 --> 03:39.189
Alright, what's next?

03:44.509 --> 03:45.629
Hajime?

03:45.629 --> 03:50.469
It's nothing. I just felt like
my demon eye sensed something.

03:50.469 --> 03:54.639
Duke, what areas did your
investigative team check?

03:54.639 --> 03:58.400
They checked the oasis, the
rivers coming off of it,

03:58.400 --> 04:00.669
and the underground reservoir.

04:00.669 --> 04:04.180
They haven't made it to the
bottom of the oasis yet.

04:05.310 --> 04:09.210
Is there some kind of artifact
at the bottom of the oasis?

04:09.210 --> 04:13.050
We use a few artifacts to secure the oasis,

04:13.050 --> 04:15.400
but they're stored above ground.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.389
What else could it be, then?

04:28.250 --> 04:29.860
Wh-What?!

04:29.860 --> 04:32.000
It's quicker than I thought.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.600
Hey, hey, hey!

04:40.600 --> 04:42.420
What are you doing, Hajime-dono?!

04:42.420 --> 04:43.639
This thing is tough.

04:43.639 --> 04:45.610
Maybe fifty more will do the trick!

04:45.610 --> 04:47.430
Don't do it!

05:06.240 --> 05:07.569
What is that?

05:12.629 --> 05:14.850
What in the world is that monster?

05:14.850 --> 05:16.079
Is it a Bachulum?

05:16.079 --> 05:17.610
It doesn't matter.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.629
This is what's polluting your water.

05:19.629 --> 05:23.129
It probably has a unique
magic that releases toxins.

05:23.129 --> 05:25.620
That would certainly make sense,

05:25.620 --> 05:27.089
but can you defeat it?

05:29.220 --> 05:31.180
Yeah, I've got it.

05:51.949 --> 05:53.379
Is it over?

05:53.379 --> 05:56.009
The oasis isn't giving me
a mana reaction anymore.

05:56.009 --> 06:01.170
I don't know if fixing the source
equals purifying the water, though.

06:02.269 --> 06:03.560
How is it?

06:03.560 --> 06:05.519
It's still contaminated.

06:06.829 --> 06:09.180
Don't be so down.

06:09.180 --> 06:12.420
We can get as much fresh water as needed.

06:12.420 --> 06:16.060
Let's get the old oasis back
while it's still within reach.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.939
Yeah, Tio is right.

06:18.490 --> 06:21.980
What was that monster, though?

06:21.980 --> 06:25.920
Did a new species come in
through the underground water?

06:25.920 --> 06:28.569
It's probably the work of the demons.

06:28.569 --> 06:29.699
The demons?!

06:30.399 --> 06:33.980
You must have some basis
for saying that, right?

06:33.980 --> 06:35.029
Kind of.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.160
We did our own investigating,

06:39.160 --> 06:42.279
but we never considered that they
could use a monster like that.

06:42.279 --> 06:43.920
We were unprepared.

06:44.649 --> 06:47.470
Let me thank you on behalf
of the nation and people.

06:47.470 --> 06:50.009
You have saved our nation.

06:50.470 --> 06:52.410
Go on, thank me.

06:52.410 --> 06:55.759
Just make sure not to forget this huge debt.

06:58.060 --> 06:59.860
Do your best.

06:59.860 --> 07:02.290
Yeah!

07:02.290 --> 07:03.860
Let's go!

07:03.860 --> 07:06.029
Everyone, listen!

07:07.899 --> 07:09.040
Hajime-kun!

07:09.040 --> 07:09.990
Hajime-san!

07:09.990 --> 07:13.170
The source of the pollution
has been eliminated.

07:13.170 --> 07:16.199
It will take time, but we
can get our oasis back.

07:18.459 --> 07:21.060
Also, we have a store of water now.

07:21.060 --> 07:23.170
It will last us until help arrives.

07:25.180 --> 07:28.810
Best of all, these gold-rank adventurers

07:28.810 --> 07:33.680
have agreed to bring us stillstone
from the Grand Gruen Volcano.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.009
Just a few more days!

07:35.009 --> 07:38.639
Stay strong, and we'll get
through this together!

07:44.220 --> 07:47.350
I'll stay behind and look after the patients.

07:47.350 --> 07:48.959
Please bring the stillstone soon.

07:48.959 --> 07:49.829
Sorry.

07:49.829 --> 07:51.399
Well, it's in our way.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.370
I'll take good care of Myu-chan.

07:54.370 --> 07:56.220
Yep, thanks.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.120
What?

08:00.120 --> 08:03.370
I'll do my best, so please
don't get hurt out there.

08:04.269 --> 08:05.500
I'll be waiting.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.350
O-Okay...

08:13.050 --> 08:14.720
Papa.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.680
Are you going to kiss Kaori-oneechan
like you kissed Yue-oneechan earlier?

08:20.850 --> 08:22.399
You did that?!

08:22.399 --> 08:24.360
Oh, you were watching.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.860
I wanna kiss Papa too!

08:26.860 --> 08:29.350
Wait until you get older.

08:29.350 --> 08:30.819
Aw...

08:31.569 --> 08:33.850
What's the meaning of this, I wonder?

08:33.850 --> 08:36.000
You were all out doing work, right?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.740
So why were you kissing Yue?

08:39.179 --> 08:40.980
Why would that happen?

08:40.980 --> 08:42.990
Was there a need for that?

08:42.990 --> 08:46.000
I see you were having fun,
and not thinking of me.

08:47.799 --> 08:49.210
It was tasty.

08:53.389 --> 08:55.720
I-I'll be going, Myu.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.799
Be a good girl while I'm gone.

08:57.799 --> 08:59.440
Okay!

09:40.629 --> 09:41.759
So hot.

09:41.759 --> 09:45.019
I'm gonna be a roasted rabbit.

09:45.389 --> 09:48.940
Hm, this is a moderate temperature for me.

09:49.539 --> 09:53.230
It is a shame I cannot
suffer the heat, though.

09:53.230 --> 09:56.450
I'll knock you into some magma later.

10:03.039 --> 10:04.700
So this is the entrance.

10:05.679 --> 10:06.580
Let's go.

10:06.929 --> 10:07.809
Yeah.

10:07.809 --> 10:08.799
Yes!

10:08.799 --> 10:09.580
Yes.

10:19.539 --> 10:21.009
What's with this place?

10:22.720 --> 10:25.100
That's stillstone, right?

10:25.100 --> 10:28.230
Yes, it certainly is, master.

10:28.909 --> 10:30.309
It's tiny.

10:30.309 --> 10:33.179
There are only pebbles of it.

10:33.179 --> 10:35.730
Somebody else took it first.

10:36.330 --> 10:41.740
We'll have to go deeper than
anyone has before to get enough.

10:58.379 --> 11:01.759
Nobody's gone past this
point and come back alive.

11:01.759 --> 11:02.720
Be careful.

11:07.100 --> 11:07.809
Spatial Severance.

11:20.850 --> 11:22.000
Want to fight?

11:39.730 --> 11:42.570
Let me do it, Hajime-san!

11:43.360 --> 11:45.879
Oh, you want to test that out?

11:47.909 --> 11:49.600
Alright!

11:51.210 --> 11:53.259
I'm gonna get you!

12:05.620 --> 12:09.799
Hajime-san, this new feature
is really powerful.

12:09.799 --> 12:10.789
So I see.

12:11.379 --> 12:14.659
I didn't know how well the magical
shock converter would work,

12:14.659 --> 12:16.289
but that's not bad.

12:20.110 --> 12:22.000
This is huge.

12:23.429 --> 12:25.679
Imagine finding this here.

12:25.679 --> 12:30.509
We can help the people of Ankaji
with all this stillstone.

12:30.509 --> 12:31.429
Yeah.

12:31.899 --> 12:35.440
All that's left is to conquer this labyrinth.

12:47.279 --> 12:49.120
It's so hot...

12:49.389 --> 12:52.120
Shea, it's only hot because
you think it's hot.

12:52.799 --> 12:55.649
It's just a flowing river.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.009
See, it's so cool.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.710
Master, I believe Yue is broken.

13:02.710 --> 13:04.590
It must be nice to feel fine right now.

13:05.370 --> 13:07.090
Let's take a break.

13:16.309 --> 13:18.539
Yue, make some ice for us.

13:18.539 --> 13:20.940
This heat is going to screw with our heads.

13:21.950 --> 13:23.309
Got it.

13:28.990 --> 13:31.840
Ahh, so cool!

13:31.840 --> 13:33.580
I feel better now!

13:36.779 --> 13:40.090
You can relax, but at
least wipe off your sweat.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.580
You'll move slower if you get too cold.

13:43.230 --> 13:45.250
Got it.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.860
You seem to be doing alright.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.470
Not as well as you.

13:49.470 --> 13:51.960
This heat is killing me.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.980
I should have brought some cooling artifacts.

13:55.379 --> 13:59.080
Hm, if even you are affected,

13:59.080 --> 14:02.440
then that must be the
concept of this labyrinth.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.909
Concept?

14:03.909 --> 14:04.870
Yes.

14:04.870 --> 14:08.070
The labyrinths are trials
to face the gods, correct?

14:08.580 --> 14:12.330
That's why I think each of
them has its own concept.

14:12.940 --> 14:15.370
For example, in the Great Orcus Labyrinth,

14:15.370 --> 14:21.250
one faces off against a variety
of monsters to gain experience.

14:22.840 --> 14:30.759
The Reisen Gorge forces you to respond to
a variety of attacks without using magic.

14:31.240 --> 14:35.269
And the Grand Gruen Volcano
is testing our ability

14:35.269 --> 14:40.149
to face surprise attacks while having
our focus impaired by the heat.

14:40.149 --> 14:41.720
That makes sense.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.990
I hadn't really thought about it,

14:43.990 --> 14:49.399
but I guess if these are trials, that
makes them the Liberators' teachings...

15:01.710 --> 15:04.629
Clean me up, Hajime.

15:13.389 --> 15:16.700
I didn't know this ride was here.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.809
Hajime-san, it's another tunnel.

15:24.809 --> 15:27.970
By my calculations, we should
be near the volcano's base.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.399
There may be something there.

15:29.759 --> 15:31.029
Yeah.

15:38.659 --> 15:39.870
Hold on!

15:50.509 --> 15:51.419
Volitation.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.320
It looks like the gem is buried.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.789
Including the ones we can't see,

16:12.789 --> 16:14.870
there must be a hundred enemies from here on.

16:14.870 --> 16:17.120
Is that where the Liberator is hiding?

16:17.470 --> 16:21.039
That would make sense based on the depth,

16:21.039 --> 16:22.870
but that would mean...

16:23.210 --> 16:26.379
Shouldn't there be a final guardian?

16:26.379 --> 16:30.179
It looks like we took a shortcut
by crossing the magma river.

16:30.179 --> 16:33.259
Do you think maybe we already passed it?

16:38.639 --> 16:39.759
Leave this to me!

16:56.409 --> 16:57.200
Spatial Severance.

17:01.529 --> 17:03.639
Yue, I'm checking that island out.

17:03.639 --> 17:04.849
Cover me.

17:14.130 --> 17:15.630
Is that a magical rock?

17:26.440 --> 17:29.279
Man, this is such a hassle.

17:29.279 --> 17:30.730
Hajime, are you okay?

17:30.730 --> 17:32.339
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:32.339 --> 17:34.690
It looks like our real opponent is here.

17:44.809 --> 17:47.859
That island really is our final stop.

17:47.859 --> 17:51.579
It's telling us to defeat
it if we want to pass.

17:51.579 --> 17:54.599
But it regenerated just now.

17:54.599 --> 17:55.970
Can we defeat it?

17:56.500 --> 18:01.349
It's probably the same kind of
monster as the Bachulum from Ankaji.

18:01.349 --> 18:02.309
Yeah.

18:02.309 --> 18:07.099
There should be a stone core somewhere
in it controlling the magma.

18:07.529 --> 18:12.230
My demon eye can't see its
position through the magma...

18:13.390 --> 18:15.779
I'll just have to crush it.

18:23.410 --> 18:26.269
I'm not using ordinary bullets anymore.

18:31.990 --> 18:33.670
Don't even think about it.

18:36.049 --> 18:39.490
I see, so we can defeat it like that.

18:39.490 --> 18:40.450
Yeah.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.049
We should get started as well.

18:45.470 --> 18:46.809
Obsidian.

18:50.150 --> 18:54.150
Take that!

19:23.470 --> 19:24.930
What is this?

19:25.309 --> 19:28.170
I know I crushed its core.

19:28.170 --> 19:31.380
Was defeating all ten not the goal?

19:31.380 --> 19:32.759
Hajime-san!

19:32.759 --> 19:35.319
Isn't that stone cracked?

19:49.799 --> 19:52.619
That makes eleven stones broken.

19:52.619 --> 19:57.130
That's the same number as
the snakes we defeated.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.630
I see.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.130
There are as many snakes as there are gems.

20:01.130 --> 20:05.640
That means the objective is
to defeat one hundred of them.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.720
We have to fight a hundred
of them in this heat.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.140
That matches this labyrinth's concept.

20:11.140 --> 20:14.650
In that case, there's only one thing to do!

20:19.029 --> 20:20.960
This will be my first one-shot in a while.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.609
Savor the taste!

20:27.130 --> 20:29.720
That puts me in the lead!

20:29.720 --> 20:34.829
Master, if I defeat the most,
I want a reward from you!

20:34.829 --> 20:36.910
No fair, Tio-san!

20:36.910 --> 20:39.819
I'll join the contest!

20:48.720 --> 20:51.369
What are those two doing?

20:51.369 --> 20:56.150
In that case, I want an all day
date, with just the two of us.

20:56.150 --> 20:57.059
Draconic Thunder!

21:02.289 --> 21:04.609
Yue-san is our biggest enemy!

21:04.970 --> 21:06.640
Yue is just glitched.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.450
That's not normal.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.240
Since they're not regenerating,

21:19.240 --> 21:21.210
these must be the last five.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.210
Yeah.

21:23.210 --> 21:25.680

21:26.089 --> 21:29.049

21:34.539 --> 21:36.349
This is the end!

21:55.069 --> 21:58.150
Hajime!

23:34.869 --> 23:37.470
Next time, "Black and White."
