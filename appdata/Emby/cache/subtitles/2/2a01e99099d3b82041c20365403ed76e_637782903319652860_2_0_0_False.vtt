WEBVTT

00:20.937 --> 00:22.981
Wow, this is quite impressive.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.108
Yes. This is a beautiful city.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.742
But it feels sad.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.661
I would have loved to show you
the dukedom in its most lively state,

00:36.661 --> 00:38.913
but there's no time.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.166
For now, we must go see my father...

02:20.598 --> 02:22.642
Bize?! Did you get help...?

02:22.642 --> 02:25.395
No, wait, did you get sick, too?!

02:25.395 --> 02:27.814
F-Father...

02:29.441 --> 02:34.612
Really? Will you save
my nation and its people?

02:34.612 --> 02:36.197
I guess.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.661
So many...

02:41.661 --> 02:43.621
Shea, let's start!

02:54.257 --> 02:55.467
Asura.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.188
Tidal Wave.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.738
How is this possible...?

03:16.738 --> 03:19.532
That should last for a while.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.888
I want to try that once!

03:41.888 --> 03:43.682
Me, too!

03:44.557 --> 03:46.351
So, next is...

03:50.188 --> 03:51.606
Hmm?

03:51.606 --> 03:52.774
Hajime?

03:52.774 --> 03:57.696
I think my Demon Eye detected something...

03:57.696 --> 04:01.700
Duke, how far did the research team get
in finding out what caused the pollution?

04:01.700 --> 04:05.537
They've analyzed the water in the
oasis and the rivers that flow out of it,

04:05.537 --> 04:07.872
and the ground-water veins.

04:07.872 --> 04:12.377
They haven't gotten around to diving
to the bottom of the oasis itself.

04:12.377 --> 04:16.256
Is there an artifact of
some sort inside the oasis?

04:16.256 --> 04:20.176
We do use certain artifacts
for security and management,

04:20.176 --> 04:22.554
but those are placed outside the oasis.

04:22.554 --> 04:25.557
Then I wonder what that is?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.359
W-What?!

04:36.359 --> 04:39.154
Dammit, it's faster than it seems.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.539
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Hajime,
what are you doing?!

04:49.539 --> 04:52.709
How stubborn. Here comes 50 more--

04:52.709 --> 04:54.085
No, I won't let you!

05:13.271 --> 05:14.773
What is that...?

05:19.861 --> 05:23.239
What is that monster? Is it a bachulum?

05:23.239 --> 05:26.785
I don't care what it is. It's got
to be the cause of the pollution.

05:26.785 --> 05:30.163
It probably has some sort
of poisonous special magic.

05:30.163 --> 05:34.417
That's a fair assumption.
But can you take it down?

05:36.294 --> 05:38.588
Yeah, no problem.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.443
Is it over?

06:00.443 --> 06:03.071
I don't detect any more mana in the oasis.

06:03.071 --> 06:08.201
I don't know if eliminating the source
immediately removed the pollution, though.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.704
How is it?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.539
It's still polluted.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.376
Don't be so down.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.462
Fresh water flows out abundantly.

06:19.462 --> 06:23.174
The oasis will return to
its former glory soon enough.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.510
Yes, Tio is right.

06:25.510 --> 06:29.014
But what was that monster?

06:29.014 --> 06:33.059
Did a new species stumble in
from the groundwater veins?

06:33.059 --> 06:35.645
My guess is, the Demons did it.

06:35.645 --> 06:40.942
The Demons?! I'm assuming you
have some reason to believe this?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.527
Yeah.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.364
We are doing our own
research as well, but...

06:46.364 --> 06:49.409
...we never thought they
could control monsters like that.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.703
We underestimated them.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.622
I thank you, as a representative
of my nation and my people.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.500
You are the savior of our nation.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.419
Yes, do be very thankful.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.839
Don't you ever forget what
a giant debt you owe me.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.344
Please keep it together...

07:07.344 --> 07:11.056
Here we go! Here we go!

07:11.056 --> 07:12.640
Listen up, everyone!

07:15.018 --> 07:16.144
Hajime-<i>kun</i>!

07:16.144 --> 07:17.312
Hajime-<i>san</i>!

07:17.312 --> 07:20.273
The source of the pollution
of the oasis has been removed!

07:20.273 --> 07:23.610
It will take some time,
but our oasis is coming back!

07:25.570 --> 07:28.031
In addition, we have a supply of water!

07:28.031 --> 07:30.408
It is enough to last
us until help arrives!

07:32.285 --> 07:35.705
Also, these gold-ranked
adventurers have accepted the quest

07:35.705 --> 07:40.585
of going to the Grand Gruen Volcano
to mine Stillstone!

07:40.585 --> 07:42.087
It'll only be a few more days!

07:42.087 --> 07:46.424
Raise your spirits, let us
overcome this hardship together!

07:51.304 --> 07:54.391
I'll stay behind and
look after the patients.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.810
Please find the Stillstone.
Sorry for all the trouble.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.895
Well, it's along the way.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.356
I'll look after Myu-<i>chan</i>.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.149
Thanks, I'm counting on you.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.697
--What is it?
--I'll do my best,

08:08.697 --> 08:11.324
so please come back safely.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.617
I'll be waiting for you.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.411
Y-Yeah.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.002
Papa.

08:22.002 --> 08:28.049
Are you going to kiss Big Sister Kaori,
like you kissed Big Sister Yue?

08:28.049 --> 08:29.467
You did?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.386
Oh, you saw?

08:31.386 --> 08:33.930
I want to kiss Papa, too!

08:33.930 --> 08:36.266
Myu, you'll have to wait
until you grow up a little.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.643
Why?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.854
What is this? Hmm?

08:40.854 --> 08:45.984
You went to work, right?
Why would you be kissing Yue?

08:45.984 --> 08:49.904
How did that happen?
How was that important?

08:49.904 --> 08:53.199
Were you having fun?
Did you forget about me?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.453
It was delicious.

09:00.665 --> 09:04.836
M-Myu, I'm leaving. Be a good girl.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.296
Yes!

09:48.004 --> 09:49.089
So hot.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.299
I'm becoming a cooked rabbit!

09:52.384 --> 09:56.596
Hmm, this is actually comfortable for me.

09:56.596 --> 10:00.350
It's too bad that
I can't writhe in the heat.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.353
I'll dunk you in some lava later.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.779
This must be the entrance.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.822
Let's go.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.865
Yes!

10:15.865 --> 10:17.283
Right!

10:26.751 --> 10:28.920
What is this place?

10:28.920 --> 10:32.173
Hmm? Is that Stillstone?

10:32.173 --> 10:35.969
Yes, it certainly is, Master.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.345
It's tiny.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.223
Just pebbles, unfortunately.

10:40.223 --> 10:43.351
I guess this area has
been mined out already.

10:43.351 --> 10:48.773
I'll have to go deeper than anyone
has ever been to mine a lot of this.

11:05.081 --> 11:10.170
This is the farthest anyone has gone
and survived. Stay sharp.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.675
Spatial Severance.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.439
You want some?

11:46.873 --> 11:49.542
Hajime-<i>san</i>, let me handle this.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.796
Oh, you want to try the new thing?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.925
Here I go!

11:58.343 --> 12:00.220
I'm coming to get you!

12:12.941 --> 12:16.778
Hajime-<i>san</i>, this new feature is
actually so powerful that it scares me.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.240
Seems so. The conversion
of mana into kinetic energy...

12:20.240 --> 12:23.118
I was wondering how effective
that would be, but yeah.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.165
Impressive.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.711
Who would have imagined such a place.

12:32.711 --> 12:37.632
With this much Stillstone,
the people of Ankaji can be saved!

12:37.632 --> 12:42.137
Yeah... Now we just have
to conquer this great labyrinth.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.401
It's so hot...

12:56.401 --> 13:00.113
Shea, it's only hot
because you think it is.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.824
That's all just water flowing around.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.201
Look, so cool...

13:06.244 --> 13:09.789
Master! Yue is losing it!

13:09.789 --> 13:12.292
Good for you, you seem fine.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.627
I guess we should take a break...

13:23.261 --> 13:28.224
Yue, make a block of ice.
This heat is breaking our brains.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.393
Got it.

13:36.608 --> 13:41.029
Oh, that's cool. I feel alive again.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.327
You can go ahead and relax,
but don't forget to wipe off your sweat.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.621
If you get too cold it could
affect your movement.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.499
Understood.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.918
Master, you seem relaxed.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.670
Not as much as you.

13:56.670 --> 14:02.467
This heat is really bad. I should have
prepared some air conditioning artifacts.

14:02.467 --> 14:06.054
Hmm, if this has an effect on you, Master,

14:06.054 --> 14:09.683
perhaps it's the concept
of this labyrinth.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.017
Concept?

14:11.017 --> 14:15.480
Yes. The Great Labyrinths are designed to
test those who seek to fight God, correct?

14:15.480 --> 14:20.068
Then I thought, perhaps
they all have a testing concept.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.779
For example, the Great Orcus Labyrinth

14:22.779 --> 14:28.493
is designed to make you fight various
monsters and gain experience.

14:29.828 --> 14:33.998
The Great Reisen Labyrinth tested your
ability to respond to all types of attacks

14:33.998 --> 14:37.377
without the help of mana, a great power.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.381
The Grand Gruen Volcano might be a test

14:41.381 --> 14:45.010
to see if you can maintain
focus in this heat,

14:45.010 --> 14:47.303
and respond to ambushes
and surprise attacks.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.849
I see. I never thought about that,

14:50.849 --> 14:56.354
but perhaps the tests themselves
are teachings of the Liberators.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.953
Wipe me down, Hajime.

15:20.754 --> 15:24.215
This reminds me of
an amusement park ride...

15:29.637 --> 15:31.890
Hajime-<i>san</i>, another tunnel.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.851
Altitude-wise,
we're right around the base.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.853
There could be something here.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.271
Yeah...

15:45.945 --> 15:47.322
Hold on!

15:57.707 --> 15:59.167
Updraft.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.394
Looks like gems are embedded in the walls.

16:17.394 --> 16:22.065
Counting the ones I can't see from here,
looks like... a hundred gems total?

16:22.065 --> 16:24.526
Is that the Liberator's hideout?

16:24.526 --> 16:30.323
Given the depth, that sounds
reasonable. But in that case...

16:30.323 --> 16:33.576
The final guardian should be here, right?

16:33.576 --> 16:37.205
We went down the lava river as a shortcut.

16:37.205 --> 16:40.834
Could we have skipped past
the guardian, maybe?

16:45.714 --> 16:47.007
I've got this!

17:03.648 --> 17:05.066
Spatial Severance.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.823
Yue, I'll go check out that island.
Cover me.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.074
Yes.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.001
Mana crystals?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.348
How many of them are there? What a bother.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.599
Hajime, you okay?

17:37.599 --> 17:42.103
Yeah, no problem.
Looks like this is the real deal.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.866
It seems like that island is the goal.

17:54.866 --> 17:58.578
It's like they're saying
"defeat us if you want to get through."

17:58.578 --> 18:03.541
But didn't they just regenerate?
Can we take them down?

18:03.541 --> 18:08.546
I think it's like that bachulum-type
monster we fought in Ankaji.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.590
Yes. There should be a core,

18:10.590 --> 18:14.636
a mana crystal, somewhere in
their body that's shaping the lava.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.012
There's too much lava in the way,

18:16.012 --> 18:20.433
not even my demon eye
can pinpoint the location.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.936
We have to destroy it.

18:30.694 --> 18:33.488
This one isn't just some normal bullet.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.954
Not on my watch.

18:43.623 --> 18:47.460
I see, that's how you beat that thing.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.171
Well then, let's join in.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.009
Dark Sphere.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.849
There!

19:31.004 --> 19:32.380
What's going on?

19:32.380 --> 19:35.216
I've confirmed that the
mana crystals were shattered.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.636
Isn't defeating those ten snakes the goal?

19:38.636 --> 19:39.929
Hajime-<i>san</i>!

19:39.929 --> 19:42.807
Aren't those gems over there broken?

19:56.738 --> 19:59.949
That makes eleven broken gems.

19:59.949 --> 20:04.371
The same as the number
of snakes we destroyed.

20:04.371 --> 20:08.458
I see. So, we have to beat
a hundred snakes...

20:08.458 --> 20:12.837
Equal to the number of gems on the wall.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.757
Killing a hundred of
those things, in this heat.

20:15.757 --> 20:18.385
Fits the concept of this labyrinth.

20:18.385 --> 20:22.055
In that case, there's only
one thing we have to do!

20:26.101 --> 20:30.146
It's been a while since the
last time I launched this! Enjoy!

20:34.150 --> 20:36.736
Looks like I have the lead!

20:36.736 --> 20:42.075
Master, if I get the most kills,
I desire a reward!

20:42.075 --> 20:47.038
Not fair, Tio-<i>san</i>! I want in on that!

20:56.089 --> 20:58.675
What are they talking about?

20:58.675 --> 20:59.843
In that case...

20:59.843 --> 21:03.471
I want a date, just the two of us.

21:03.471 --> 21:04.806
Lightning Wyrm!

21:09.352 --> 21:11.938
Yue is the biggest rival!

21:11.938 --> 21:15.775
Yue is bugged!
There's something wrong with her!

21:24.451 --> 21:28.705
There aren't any more appearing,
seems like these five are the last ones.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.876
I'll take two!

21:32.876 --> 21:36.379
Grand Gruen Volcano, conquest complete!

21:41.468 --> 21:43.345
The end!

22:02.364 --> 22:04.616
Hajime!

23:42.005 --> 23:44.799
Next episode, "Black and White."
